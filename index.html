	<!-- Argument -->
	<h2>How Many Flavours Are There?!</h2>
	<p>Ice cream is by far the superior dessert. There is something for everybody! There are thousands of different flavours, some you may not have even though of such as bacon! Not only are there thousands of flavours, there are also thousands of different companies/brands which make ice cream, all with their own take on the flavours. You may not really care for the french vanilla that one brand makes but may love the french vanilla from a different brand.</p>

	<h2>You Mean There's More Variety?!</h2>
	<p>Along with all of its different flavours, ice cream also comes in many different forms. There is soft serve, hard ice cream, milkshakes, and even ice cream treats such as ice cream sandwiches! This adds to the variety that it offers and helps to cater to different people's tastes. It is often served in either a bowl or a cone, and if you have it in a cone, you can choose whatever kind of cone suits you best.</p>

	<h2>It Is For Everyone!</h2>
	<p>Another reason that ice cream is so amazing is that it even offers options for those who cannot normally eat it. Some people may be lactose intolerants and eating it makes them uncomfortable or even sick. There are some companies that make lactose-free ice cream so that those who are usually unable to have it can enjoy the delicious treat. The same goes for those who are vegan. For these types of ice creams, a dairy substitute is used.</p>
